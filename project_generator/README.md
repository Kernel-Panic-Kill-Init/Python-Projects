# 🥟 Random App Idea Picker

## Main features

1. It must work.
2. It must do the job for me – because I'm lazy af.
3. It can't complain that there's too much work.

## Why does this thing exist?

Everyone and their grandma says “do a weather app, to-do list, tic-tac-toe…”  
Real talk? There’s way too many ideas and no clue what to pick next. Like most beginners, I had a list of 50+ app ideas and zero motivation to decide which one should be next.  
So why not let code make the decision for me?

**This app randomly picks an idea from a file (CSV, XLSX, etc) and shows it. Once I've picked and worked on something, that idea gets moved to a 'done' list/file. Clean, no repeats, and no more worrying about what's next.**

## Usage

1. Create your app ideas file (CSV or Excel – one row per idea).
2. Run the app. It randomly picks an idea and displays it.
3. Finished the project? Mark it as done – it gets logged in another file/list so you won’t see it again.
4. Optionally: Add new ideas, review your “done” history, and enjoy not having to make decisions.

## Motivation

To be honest, most people getting into IT have no idea where to start, what to build, or how to choose the next project.  
This is just one way to automate the process and keep learning – minus the stress!

## Future plans

- CLI improvements
- Support for more file formats (maybe Google Sheets integration?)
- Funnier error messages (because who likes boring errors?)
- Gamification (XP for every completed app?)
